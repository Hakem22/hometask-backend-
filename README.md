# hometask-backend-

Time spent in Global: Around 5 hours beacause I had some unexcpected interuuptions in my place.

Gloabl impression: I enjoyed working on the whole project even if I had had unexcpted errors with importing some libraries.

Things That I would like to add/change:
    - Add Global Error Handler in Angular 7
    - Handle HTTP error in backend.
    - Run backend in Docker container.
    - Adjust styling.
    - change structure in frontend to make it more modular
